**Disclaimer**

1. This implementation, uses a method of Swizzling and editing "Private APIs" in WKWebView, to intercept requests. This is against App Review guidelines and is not recommended to be used in production builds.

2. While building this, I have discovered some new limitations around [Granite](https://github.com/pexavc/Granite), which I will be addressing soon. If some UX interactions seem fragile/odd, I am aware of them. Like [Issue #1](https://github.com/pexavc/Granite/issues/1) in the repo, these are quite deep and have simply been sidetracked open-sourcing and/or building out small fun tools like Bitsy.

## Requirements

## Guide

### Intercepting

> Comments in linked files, explain further

[**Observing HTML `<video />`**](https://github.com/pexavc/Bitsy/tree/main/Shared/Views/WebView/VideoPlayerEvent.js)

On the Swift side, we should tell `WKWebView` to [listen to a custom handler](https://github.com/pexavc/Bitsy/tree/main/Shared/Views/WebView/WebView.swift#L27-L33) we call `callbackHandler`.

```swift
fileprivate func createHandler(_ handler: WKScriptMessageHandlerWithReply) -> WKUserContentController {
    let contentController = WKUserContentController()

    contentController.addScriptMessageHandler(handler, contentWorld: .page, name: "callbackHandler")
    
    return contentController
}
```

On the JS side, we fire this handler, when a video DOM element is playing. (Yes, there could be multiple videos on the page that could trip this).
```js
for (var i = 0; i < videos.length; i++) {
    videos.item(i).onplaying = function() {
        webkit.messageHandlers.callbackHandler.postMessage("VideoIsPlaying");
    }
}
```

[**XHR (Kick's Solution)**](https://github.com/pexavc/Bitsy/tree/main/Shared/Views/WebView/InterceptXHR.js)

Kick, fires an XHR request to fetch metadata regarding the stream. The response has the HLS playlist file. We handle the callback in swift and set the URL to begin streaming.

```swift
if messageString.contains("StreamURL") {
    
    let sanitized: String = messageString.replacingOccurrences(of: "StreamURL:", with: "").trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)
    
    if let url = URL(string: sanitized) {
        
        print("[WebView.Coordinator] Found StreamURL: \(sanitized)")
        
        updateContentURL(url)
    }

 ...
}
```

[**Swizzling in Swift (Twitch Solution)**](https://github.com/pexavc/Bitsy/blob/main/Shared/Views/WebView/WebView.Swizzle.swift)

Twitch is a little complicated. They are actually updating their API, I believe, to prevent easy stream link fetching which is why I feel there's a lot more measures in place here. Not only that, since iOS14, NSURLProtocol class registration has lots of checks in place, in which some requests aren't available out of the box in the usual methods of interception.

Based on the [Obj-C implementation](https://github.com/wilddylan/WKWebViewWithURLProtocol/blob/master/WKWebViewWithURLProtocol/NSURLProtocol%2BWKWebViewSupport.m) by [@wilddylan](https://github.com/wilddylan) this Swift implementation, edits a key-value property of WKBrowsing. [Here's the exact header file of the private Apple package I am talking about.](https://github.com/MP0w/iOS-Headers/blob/master/iOS8.1/PrivateFrameworks/WebKit/WKBrowsingContextController.h)

> Note: Yes, App Review teams can detect if such variables are modified and you can risk rejection.

```swift
extension URLProtocol {
    
    class func contextControllerClass()->AnyClass {
        return NSClassFromString("WKBrowsingContextController")!
    }
    
    class func registerSchemeSelector()->Selector {
        return NSSelectorFromString("registerSchemeForCustomProtocol:")
    }
    
    class func unregisterSchemeSelector()->Selector {
        return NSSelectorFromString("unregisterSchemeForCustomProtocol:")
    }
    
    class func wk_register(scheme:String){
        let cls: AnyClass = contextControllerClass()
        let sel = registerSchemeSelector()
        if cls.responds(to: sel) {
            _ = (cls as AnyObject).perform(sel, with: scheme)
        }
    }
    
    class func wk_unregister(scheme:String){
        let cls: AnyClass = contextControllerClass()
        let sel = unregisterSchemeSelector()
        if cls.responds(to: sel) {
            _ = (cls as AnyObject).perform(sel, with: scheme)
        }
    }
}
```

The bigger caveat is, there is a check in place, that prevents Twitch from loading the stream at all. And my theory is around a blocked `POST` response. Which is more on Apple's side, I believe, rather than Twitch's. As a security feature to prevent unwarranted custom URL Protocols intercepting `http/https urlschemes`.

So we just simply, wait for it to complete, [then we Swizzle](https://github.com/pexavc/Bitsy/tree/main/Shared/Views/WebView/WebView.Coordinator.swift#L157-L162), and then unregister the overrides after we fetch the HLS url.


### Bypassing Walls

> May be used in the future, but implementation is in place

Sometimes there are dialog boxes or overlays that could block a stream from loading. 

Systems have been put in place to setup a basic automation routing to click through these until a stream can be found.

```swift
Button {
    action = .automateClick("Start watching") { result in
        
    }
} label : {
    Text("Automate Click")
}
```

Set the client into [debug mode](https://github.com/pexavc/Bitsy/tree/main/Shared/Components/Home/Home%2BCenter.swift#L32-L36) here and turn `isHeadless` off.

```swift
var webViewConfig: WebViewConfig {
    .init(.stream(state.streamKind),
          isHeadless: true,// -> false
          isDebug: false)// -> true
}
```

Then, you can play around/experiment with automation. Editing the button actions [here](https://github.com/pexavc/Bitsy/tree/main/Shared/Views/WebView/GraniteWebView.swift#L41-L91).
